YmsGradientButton

iOS UIButton subclass featuring plist configured bitmap-free gradients.

NOTE: MAJOR PLIST SPECIFICATION CHANGE

* Colors in the plist files must now have an alpha channel field defined
  to comply with an ARGB (alpha, red, green, blue) format using a
  32-bit integer. So for example, a color set to 0xADBEEF should be
  changed to 0xFFADBEEF to have the alpha channel set to 1.0.
  (0xFF/255 = 255/255 = 1.0).
  This change will break all plists using checkouts of this codebase 
  before January 12, 2012. However, only the color values in your plist 
  need to change to support an alpha channel field. All other plist fields
  remain unchanged. 

  To be clear - There are no API changes. Period.

  For you early adopters out there - thanks for your patience. 


QUICKSTART: 

* Copy YmsGradientButton.[hm], YmsStyleSheet.h and YmsGradientButton.plist to 
  your project.
* Add the QuartzCore.framework to your project.
* Instantiate a UIButton in Interface Builder. With the identity inspector, 
  set the custom class to YmsGradientButton.
* Configure the gradients of the button for the different UIControlStates 
  normal, highlighted, and disabled in the file YmsGradientButton.plist.
  The settings map to the properties defined in CAGradientLayer.
* You can subclass YmsGradientButton and create a plist with the subclass
  name to create your own custom button.
* YmsGradientButton can also be instantiated programmatically.

NOTES:
* This code is written using ARC.
