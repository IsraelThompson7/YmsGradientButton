YmsGradientButton

iOS UIButton subclass featuring plist configured bitmap-free gradients.

QUICKSTART: 

* Copy YmsGradientButton.[hm], YmsStyleSheet.h and YmsGradientButton.plist to 
  your project.
* Add the QuartzCore.framework to your project.
* Instantiate a UIButton in Interface Builder. With the identity inspector, 
  set the custom class to YmsGradientButton.
* Configure the gradients of the button for the different UIControlStates 
  normal, highlighted, and disabled in the file YmsGradientButton.plist.
  The settings map to the properties defined in CAGradientLayer.
* You can subclass YmsGradientButton and create plist with the subclass name to
  create your own custom button.
* YmsGradientButton can also be instantiated programmatically.

NOTES:
* This code is written using ARC.
